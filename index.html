        <p> According to DNA evidence, modern birds (Neornithes) evolved in the Middle to Upper Cretaceous.[2] More recent estimates, using a new way of calibrating molecular clocks, showed that modern birds originated early in the Upper Cretaceous. However, diversification occurred around the Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction event.[3]

            The Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction event 66 million years ago killed off all the non-avian dinosaur lines. Birds, especially those in the southern continents, survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world.[4]
            
            Primitive bird-like dinosaurs are in the broader group Avialae. </p>
